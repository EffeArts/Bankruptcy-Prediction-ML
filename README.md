# Bankruptcy-Prediction-ML

This project explores 3 different classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor KNN, Logistic Regression, and Data Tree Classifier. They are used to train and build a prediction model using existing public dataset. The dataset has records of bankrupt and non-bankrupt business organizations with different covariates that can are used to predict bankruptcy. With the help of different python libraries for data science, a data preprocessing and transformation pipeline was constructed before feeding it to the aforementioned training models.

The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.
